// Package elf writes an *obj.Object as an ELF relocatable object.
//
// One function, elf.Write. The target is derived from the object's Arch —
// ArchARM64 implies ELFCLASS64, little-endian, EM_AARCH64 — because an object
// states what it was assembled for and a writer that took that as an argument
// would be a second place for the answer to live.
//
// Emission goes through github.com/vertex-language/elf, the same module that
// reads these objects back, so a round-trip test is a round trip and not two
// independent guesses about the format. That module is imported under an
// alias here so the package a caller names is elf and the call site stays
// elf.Write.
//
// This package is a leaf. Nothing in arm64/obj imports it, and a build that
// emits Mach-O or COFF never compiles a line of it.
