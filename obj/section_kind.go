// SectionKind is how a section behaves at load time.

// be spelled some way, and one of the three containers had to be the one the
// vocabulary borrows from.

	// RelROData is read-only data that a loader has to write first.
	//
	// A constant whose value is another symbol's address -- a vtable,
	// a table of function pointers, a const pointer -- is not known
	// until something has relocated it, so its bytes cannot live
	// somewhere never written. Nor do they belong in .data: once the
	// relocation is applied the bytes are constant, and leaving them
	// writable for the life of the process gives an attacker a table
	// of function pointers to edit.
	//
	// The three containers answer this differently, which is why it
	// is a kind rather than a name. ELF has .data.rel.ro, allocated
	// and writable, which the loader mprotects read-only after
	// relocating. Mach-O has (__DATA,__const), which ld moves into
	// the __DATA_CONST segment. COFF has no such concept and does not
	// need one: base relocations are applied before page protections
	// are set, so read-only .rdata is both correct and already what
	// this wants.
